Here, we are first reducing components using PCA, then testing the data using ML algorithms.


Summary


1) What we are doing in this question:-  
  -> loading of iris data (all features).
  -> spliting 80% of this data for training & remaining 20% data for testing.
  -> Now, we creates a classifier, then we train & fit this classifier object, and finally, we predict our testing data.
  -> Calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score & ploting this versus no. of neighbours.
  -> To get a clear insight, we are plotting the performance measures with neighbors individually & together also.
  -> Now, we plot classification region on the basis of Best & Worst classifier.

 Note:- We are doing this process:- 
        1) for k values 1 to 50. Hence, no. of neighbours in X-axis of plot is from 1 to 50
        2) for both uniform & distance weighted classifier.
        3) for both micro & macro averaged precision, recall and f1 score.
        4) calculating & plotting accuracy, precision, recall and f1 score
           for both overall data(all classes included) and for each classes(class 1, class 2, class 3) individually.
        5) plotting the classification region for both uniform & distance model (for the best & worst classifier.)

2) What we observed & concluded after completing this second question of the assignment:- 
   -> For micro-averaged, precision, recall and f1 score are same, & therefore graph is also similar.
   -> For macro-averaged, precision, recall and f1 are different, but, with a very small margin as we can see in the plots.
   -> We can also calculate precision, recall and f1 for each classes(class 1, class 2, class 3) using confusion matrix.
   
   -> Best classifier is that classifier which shows best accuracy or less error rate at any particular value of "k".
   -> Worst classifier is that classifier which shows least accuracy or high error rate at any particular value of "k".
